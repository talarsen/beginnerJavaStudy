<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>There are so many resources available to get started with Java. It was suggested that I start with the Heads First Java book.  These short programs are from the book. So far, 
I feel like the book has done a stellar job of teaching me Java syntax. I am looking forward to completing the book.
